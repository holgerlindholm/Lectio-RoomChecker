# Lectio-RoomChecker
Lectio RoomChecker is a program that lets students know weather a room is available or not at a given date in a given module. The api/scraper-program is based on the danish educational intranet, www.lectio.dk. 

_______________________________

This repository will in its final form contain multiple branches; one for each platform on which the program wille be released: I am new to programming and will therefore use this project as a leaning process of getting to know programming on different platforms. 

I am currently thinking of releasing the program as: (eventhough it isn't neccesary at all!)
  - a webpage
  - an android app (google play store)
  - an os app (app-store)
  - an app for the windows-store
  - a computer program (.exe)

The goals might be adjusted along the way...
